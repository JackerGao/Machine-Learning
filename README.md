# Machine-Learning
###Focus on ML Algorithm,DL Algorithm,Community Detection and its Development in Fintech.

###But in this section, Focus on the application of ML Algorithm in Credit-Model.

I. Practice Background.

  In the Fintech, in order to decrease the overdue rate, Credit-checking of a person is necessary and usually work done by hand in traditional financial institution. As the development of the distributed system and the improvement of the computational capabilities, Machine Learning is playing more important role in Fintech. Obviously, with the help of the ML Algorithm, Credit-checking can be easily done by Machine and it can greatly free our body.
    In this section, use XGBOOST to model the bid-overdue rate and bid-return rate in given days. 
  
II. Credit-model goal.

  Modeling the bid-overdue rate and bid-return rate in special days, obtain Credit models to predict bid-overdue rate and bid-return in given days,such as 7 days or 30 days based on specific requirements.
  
III.Implemention architecture.
